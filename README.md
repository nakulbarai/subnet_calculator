# subnet_calculator

This is Nakul. I have created this python code for IP subnetting. You just need run this code and it will ask you  IP e.g. 10.0.0.0/16 and number of network. Number of network must be in the below format.
e.g. for network IP 192.168.1.0/24 you wnat to subnet it for /28 that means you will get 14 host IP. Then please enter 28 for network number. This code will be very helpful in creating network automation script or creating VPC on AWS.
